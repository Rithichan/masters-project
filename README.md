# Masters project: Collisional model methods for modeling memoryful open quantum dynamics

## Semester1: Modelling Non Markovian Collisional models in state vector formulation of QM

1. Unitary Operation
- Shows some unitary evolution of combined system over time.
- Comparison between joint system evolution vs separating system and operating.

2. Sequential Generation of entangled multiqubit states with unitary operation
- Computational sequential generation of GHZ state while operating with unitary operator at every step.
- Comparison with direct operation on joint state and system to show method works

3. Uncompute
- Using the adjoint of the left/right unitary from SVD, can reduce the size of the tensor and reduce it to an identity type object, while leaving the forward states intact.

Code:
- Test Models
- Fully working code in Collisional_model_simulator.py

## Semester2: In progress
